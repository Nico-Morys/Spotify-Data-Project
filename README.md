Top 100 Songs Annually From 2010 - 2019


Hello!

Welcome to my Spotify Data Project. This project was designed to showcase my SQL query and database creation skills in Oracle Apex. I gathered data from the kaggle data set linked here, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhmores/spotify-top-100-songs-of-20152019. Since 2010, there have been many different songs to reach the top 100 list. From the beats per minute of a song to the decibel level, there are many different attributes that can contribute to a songâ€™s popularity. My goal was to identify how these different attributes affect each other and impact how popular a song becomes.
